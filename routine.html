            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Building Your Routine</h2>
            <p>Creating a skincare routine tailored to your skin type is essential for achieving healthy, glowing skin. Follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 1: Cleanse</h3>
                    <p>Cleansing is the foundation of every skincare routine. It helps remove dirt, oil, pollution, and makeup from your skin, preventing clogged pores and breakouts. Use a gentle cleanser that suits your skin type—gel cleansers for oily skin, cream cleansers for dry skin, and micellar water for sensitive skin. Cleansing twice daily, in the morning and evening, ensures your skin stays fresh and clean. Avoid harsh soaps that strip the skin’s natural oils, as they can lead to dryness and irritation. Pat your face dry with a soft towel and move on to the next step.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Exfoliate</h3>
                    <p>Exfoliation helps slough off dead skin cells that can make your skin look dull and clog your pores. Depending on your skin type, use a chemical exfoliant like AHAs (for dry skin) or BHAs (for oily/acne-prone skin) 2–3 times a week. Avoid physical scrubs with harsh beads as they can cause microtears. Regular exfoliation reveals a brighter complexion, improves texture, and helps other skincare products absorb better. However, be careful not to overdo it—too much exfoliation can lead to redness, peeling, or sensitivity. Always follow with hydration to soothe freshly exfoliated skin.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Tone</h3>
                    <p>A toner helps balance the skin’s pH after cleansing and preps it for better absorption of serums and moisturizers. Today’s toners are not the alcohol-based ones of the past; many are hydrating, soothing, or packed with beneficial ingredients like hyaluronic acid, rose water, witch hazel, or green tea. Apply toner with a cotton pad or gently press it into your skin with clean hands. Choose one based on your skin concerns—hydrating toners for dry skin, clarifying ones for acne-prone skin. This step refreshes your skin and sets the stage for treatments that follow.</p>

                    <h3>Step 4: Treat</h3>
                    <p>This is where you address your specific skin concerns with serums, essences, or spot treatments. For acne, look for ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. For dullness or uneven tone, use vitamin C or niacinamide. For hydration, hyaluronic acid or peptides are ideal. Apply your serum to slightly damp skin and allow it to absorb fully. Use a single treatment at a time or layer them in order of thinnest to thickest texture. This step is all about targeted action—so consistency and patience are key to seeing lasting results over time.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Step 5: Moisturize</h3>
                    <p>Moisturizer is essential for sealing in hydration and supporting your skin’s natural barrier. Even oily skin needs moisture—skipping this step can actually trigger more oil production. Choose a moisturizer that suits your skin type: lightweight gel for oily skin, creamy formula for dry skin, and soothing formulas for sensitive skin. A good moisturizer prevents water loss, maintains skin elasticity, and gives your face a smooth, plump appearance. Apply it while your skin is still slightly damp from toner or serum for maximum absorption. This step locks in all the goodness from earlier in your routine.</p>

                    <h3>Step 6: Protect</h3>
                    <p>Sunscreen is the most important step in your morning routine. It shields your skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays that cause premature aging, hyperpigmentation, and increase the risk of skin cancer. Use a broad-spectrum SPF of at least 30 every day—even when it’s cloudy or you’re indoors near windows. Sunscreen should be applied as the final step in your morning routine, after moisturizer. If you’re outdoors for extended periods, reapply every 2 hours. Consistent use of sunscreen keeps your skin looking youthful, healthy, and protected against environmental damage.</p>
